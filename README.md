According to U.S. Census data released in 2019, the Seattle metropolitan area's population stands at 3.98 million, making it the 15th-largest in the United States. As the headquarters of Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft, Seattle attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies and their employees. The city has found itself "bursting at the seams", and with the country's sixth-worst rush hour traffic.Driving to Seattle city to visit some friends or enjoy some seafood is almost a routine for people living in Vancouver. 

However, it is always rainy and windy in this area, and on the way, you always come across a terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway, with long lines of cars barely moving. It would be great if there is something in place that could warn you, given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that you would drive more carefully or even change your travel if you are able to. 

Luckily enough, The Seattle Police Department (SPD) has recorded all car collision accident from 2004 to present. Basing on those historical data (194,673 records), we can create a map and information chart to help us understand the high-risk areas, understand car injury factors to avoid accident, and plan our next trip to Seattle better.
